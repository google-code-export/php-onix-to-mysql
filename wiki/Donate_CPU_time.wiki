Malaria is a nasty desease that should get extinct. To help scientists achieve that goal we can contribute CPU time.<br>It' simple, while our computer is doing nothing but is running, it can in the background help to exterminate malaria.

= How to do so =
Download [http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php this] program, execute it, install for all users and then place [code.google.com/p/php-onix-to-mysql/downloads/detail?name=account_www.malariacontrol.net.xml&can=2&q= this] file in the folder applicable to  your version of windows (or other operating system)

*windows 7*
{{{
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\BOINC
}}}

*Windows XP*
{{{
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\BOINC
}}}

and then restart the ccomputer.
Why use this custom file? That is so that I can see how many people contribute because of this project :)
